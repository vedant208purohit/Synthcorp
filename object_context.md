| **CentralControlSystem** | This class implements the Singleton Pattern, ensuring a single, central point of control for the entire manufacturing system. It manages and coordinates all major components.                                                                              | The `CentralControlSystem` is the "brain" of SynthCorp, centralizing critical information and operations. It's crucial for maintaining consistency across the system, enabling global status monitoring (e.g., `get_all_machines`, `check_safety_protocols`), and ensuring coordinated actions (e.g., `emergency_shutdown`). Its singleton nature guarantees a unified state for the entire factory.                                                                              |
| **Machine**              | An abstract base class defining the common interface and properties for all types of machines within the factory. It encapsulates fundamental behaviors like starting, stopping, and running diagnostics, and incorporates the State and Observer patterns. | The `Machine` object's `_state` is paramount as it dictates the machine's operational capability and indicates its health. A machine in an `ERROR` state, for example, cannot `start_operation`. `_performance_data` is essential for monitoring efficiency and detecting issues early. The `_observers` list allows components like the `MaintenanceEngineer` to receive real-time updates and react to events, making the system responsive to changes without direct polling.  |
| **InventorySystem**      | This system is responsible for managing all raw materials and finished products within the factory. It includes functionalities for adding and removing items, tracking quantities, setting reorder levels, and simulating ordering processes.              | The `InventorySystem` directly impacts the continuity of production. Low `quantity` in `inventory` can halt production lines. The `reorder_levels` are critical for proactive supply chain management, ensuring materials are replenished before they run out. Information on `on_order` items helps in planning and forecasting. This system is foundational for efficient resource allocation and preventing operational bottlenecks.                                           |
| **ProductionLine**       | Represents a configured manufacturing line, assembled using the Builder Pattern, that combines various types of robots and operates under a specific production strategy. It encapsulates the process of starting and stopping production.                  | The `ProductionLine` is the operational unit of the factory. Its `status` directly reflects whether manufacturing is active. The types and number of `robots` assigned define its capabilities and capacity. The chosen `production_strategy` significantly influences efficiency, resource consumption, and output characteristics (e.g., batch size vs. customization). It represents the flexible and configurable nature of the manufacturing process.                        |
| **MaintenanceEngineer**  | This class acts as an `Observer` that actively monitors `Machine` objects for any signs of maintenance needs, such as errors or state changes. It logs these alerts and can trigger urgent actions.                                                         | The `MaintenanceEngineer` is a critical component for system reliability and uptime. By receiving `alerts` in real-time, it enables immediate response to machine malfunctions or maintenance requirements. Tracking `machine_states` provides context for alerts and aids in diagnostics. This object highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and human intervention in an automated manufacturing environment, directly contributing to preventing extended downtime. |
