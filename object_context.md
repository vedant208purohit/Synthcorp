| **CentralControlSystem** | This class implements the Singleton Pattern, ensuring a single, central point of control for the entire manufacturing system. It manages and coordinates all major components.                                                                              | - `_machines`: A dictionary holding all registered machines in the factory. <br> - `_production_orders`: A list of production orders waiting to be processed. <br> - `_active_production`: References the production order currently being executed. <br> - `_inventory`: A dictionary tracking the current levels of all inventory items. <br> - `_safety_protocols`: A list of active safety rules and conditions for the factory.                                                                | The `CentralControlSystem` is the "brain" of SynthCorp, centralizing critical information and operations. It's crucial for maintaining consistency across the system, enabling global status monitoring (e.g., `get_all_machines`, `check_safety_protocols`), and ensuring coordinated actions (e.g., `emergency_shutdown`). Its singleton nature guarantees a unified state for the entire factory.                                                                              |
| **Machine**              | An abstract base class defining the common interface and properties for all types of machines within the factory. It encapsulates fundamental behaviors like starting, stopping, and running diagnostics, and incorporates the State and Observer patterns. | - `_machine_id`: A unique identifier for each machine instance. <br> - `_name`: The human-readable name of the machine. <br> - `_state`: The current operational state of the machine (e.g., IDLE, ACTIVE, MAINTENANCE, ERROR), controlled by the State Pattern. <br> - `_performance_data`: A dictionary storing various performance metrics and diagnostic results. <br> - `_observers`: A list of objects that are notified of changes in the machine's state or performance (Observer Pattern). | The `Machine` object's `_state` is paramount as it dictates the machine's operational capability and indicates its health. A machine in an `ERROR` state, for example, cannot `start_operation`. `_performance_data` is essential for monitoring efficiency and detecting issues early. The `_observers` list allows components like the `MaintenanceEngineer` to receive real-time updates and react to events, making the system responsive to changes without direct polling.  |
| **InventorySystem**      | This system is responsible for managing all raw materials and finished products within the factory. It includes functionalities for adding and removing items, tracking quantities, setting reorder levels, and simulating ordering processes.              | - `inventory`: A dictionary where keys are `item_id`s and values are dictionaries containing `name` and `quantity` of each item. <br> - `reorder_levels`: A dictionary mapping `item_id`s to the minimum quantity threshold that triggers a reorder. <br> - `on_order`: A dictionary tracking quantities of items that have been ordered but not yet received. <br> - `suppliers`: A dictionary linking `item_id`s to their respective suppliers.                                                   | The `InventorySystem` directly impacts the continuity of production. Low `quantity` in `inventory` can halt production lines. The `reorder_levels` are critical for proactive supply chain management, ensuring materials are replenished before they run out. Information on `on_order` items helps in planning and forecasting. This system is foundational for efficient resource allocation and preventing operational bottlenecks.                                           |
| **ProductionLine**       | Represents a configured manufacturing line, assembled using the Builder Pattern, that combines various types of robots and operates under a specific production strategy. It encapsulates the process of starting and stopping production.                  | - `name`: The descriptive name given to the production line. <br> - `assembly_robots`, `packaging_robots`, `quality_control_bots`: Lists of `Machine` objects assigned to perform specific tasks within the line. <br> - `production_strategy`: The concrete `ProductionStrategy` instance (e.g., `MassProductionStrategy`) that dictates how production is carried out. <br> - `status`: The current operational status of the production line (e.g., "idle", "running").                          | The `ProductionLine` is the operational unit of the factory. Its `status` directly reflects whether manufacturing is active. The types and number of `robots` assigned define its capabilities and capacity. The chosen `production_strategy` significantly influences efficiency, resource consumption, and output characteristics (e.g., batch size vs. customization). It represents the flexible and configurable nature of the manufacturing process.                        |
| **MaintenanceEngineer**  | This class acts as an `Observer` that actively monitors `Machine` objects for any signs of maintenance needs, such as errors or state changes. It logs these alerts and can trigger urgent actions.                                                         | - `name`: The name of the maintenance engineer. <br> - `alerts`: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about a received alert, including timestamp, machine ID, name, and message. <br> - `machine_states`: A dictionary tracking the latest known `MachineState` for each observed machine.                                                                                                                                                                                              | The `MaintenanceEngineer` is a critical component for system reliability and uptime. By receiving `alerts` in real-time, it enables immediate response to machine malfunctions or maintenance requirements. Tracking `machine_states` provides context for alerts and aids in diagnostics. This object highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and human intervention in an automated manufacturing environment, directly contributing to preventing extended downtime. |
